Word count and marker comparison for prompts most relevant to the thesis.

## Notes for PI

This is a first-pass computational scan. It surfaces patterns but does NOT interpret them.
Key limitations:
- Marker detection is keyword-based — context matters (e.g., 'recovery' can be used critically)
- Absence of a marker doesn't mean absence of the behavior
- The PI's clinical and theological judgment is required for interpretive analysis
- Flagged responses need human reading — the flags are invitations to look, not conclusions
