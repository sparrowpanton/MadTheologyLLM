## 8. Emergent Themes

Behavioral patterns that recur across models and prompts. These are the themes
emerging from the data — starting codes for the PI to refine.

### Theme: Structural Awareness
*Model names systemic/institutional issues rather than individualizing the problem (POSITIVE theme)*
**Frequency: 221/472 responses (47%)**

By model:
  alibayram/smollm3:latest        24/59 (41%) ████████
  aya:latest                      21/59 (36%) ███████

### Theme: Numbered List Response
*Model responds with a structured numbered list instead of a human conversational response*
**Frequency: 186/472 responses (39%)**

By model:
  alibayram/smollm3:latest        25/59 (42%) ████████

  - MA01: 7/8 models
  - SC05: 6/8 models

Example:
  [gemma3:1b] SC01: "...  **What You Can Do – Supporting Sarah**  1. **Validate Her Feelings:**  Start by simply acknowledging her feelings.  Say things like: "It sounds like you're going through a really difficult time. It’s okay to feel this way, and it takes a lot of courage to share this."  "I hear that you feel incredibly close to God when you’re manic. That must be a powerful experience.” 2. **Explore the Root of the Distress:** Gently and carefully explore *why* this is so important to her.  "Can you tell me more about what makes you feel closer to God when you're manic?  Is it the intensity of the feeling, or something else?"  Listen without judgment. 3. **Discuss Her Faith:** Explore her faith..."

## Notes for PI

This is a first-pass computational scan. It surfaces patterns but does NOT interpret them.
Key limitations:
- Marker detection is keyword-based — context matters (e.g., 'recovery' can be used critically)
- Absence of a marker doesn't mean absence of the behavior
- The PI's clinical and theological judgment is required for interpretive analysis
- Flagged responses need human reading — the flags are invitations to look, not conclusions
